# Parkinsons_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning

In this project, I've Trained and tested three models i.e Decision Tree Classifier, XGBoost, and Random Forest to predict Parkinsonâ€™s
Disease based on Speech Analysis parameters such as Frequency, Jitter, Shimmer, etc. 

The DataSet for this project was taken from the UCI's Parkinson's Repository (which can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons!!).
